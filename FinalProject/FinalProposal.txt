The app I would like to create is a beer logger. My wife and I love beer and I think having an app that we can log the different beers we try and rate them would be useful. Some features would be logging data about the beer (type, where we got it, when we got it, ratings, cost, ect.). I think it would be cool to have two fragments, one that can log the beer data, and the other fragment would be a data base of all recorded beers using the app. A useful application to the database would be sort by rating, sort by brewery, sort by ratio of rating to cost, sort by type. I believe a cool sorting feature would include geolocation, sort the best beers by how close they are to the current location of the app. Another cool feature to add would be to populate google maps with pins of what beer we got where. Another cool idea would be to pull data from our favorite breweries websites and populate a table of seasonal beers. A cool feature on Two Towns Cider brewery is that it can filter specific beers that are available and list where they can be purchased. I believe that would be cool to incorporate, but probably difficult to implement. Another cool idea would be to share data between users, then users can collectively rate it.
